This project demonstrates the implementation of Neural Style Transfer (NST) using a pre-trained model from Google. NST is a technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another, creating a unique image that retains the subject of the content image while adopting the artistic flair of the style image.
Features
Content Image: The main image whose structure and content are preserved.
Style Image: The image that provides the artistic style to be applied to the content image.
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network from Google, optimized for NST.
Customizable Parameters: Allows for adjustment of style and content weights to control the blend of content and style.
High-Resolution Output: Generates high-quality stylized images.
